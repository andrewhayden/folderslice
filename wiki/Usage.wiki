#summary Instructions for using Folderslice

= Introduction =

Folderslice presents a wealth of information with relatively few controls.  To start, simply drag a folder or a drive onto the gadget.  The gadget will analyze the contents of the folder you dragged, and will display a brief summary of the results.  You can hit the "Cancel" button at any time to abort processing.

By default, Folderslice displays only the 3 largest folders within the item you have dragged; if you want to see more information, just click on the "Details..." link (as shown above) to bring up a more verbose page (shown below).



= The Controls =
Controlling Folderslice really is simple; but as the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.  To that end, the following picture shows all of the controls available in both the docked gadget (on the right, in the sidebar) as well as the flyout page (the large panel at left):

= Miscellaneous =
  * Clicking anywhere outside of the flyout window or gadget will cause the flyout window to hide.  You can show it again by clicking on the "Details..." link as you did before.
  * If you bring up the details pane for a folder that contains _many_ child folders, it may take several seconds to display the flyout, during which the application may be unresponsive.
  * You can drag another folder or drive onto the gadget at any time.  Doing so will discard the current results and begin analysis on the dragged item.
