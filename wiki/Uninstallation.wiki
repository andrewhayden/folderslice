Uninstallation of FolderSlice is very simple.  Just follow these steps:

  # Start the Sidebar (Click: Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Windows Sidebar)
  # At the top of the sidebar you will see a "+" symbol.  Click on it.
  # A window will come up listing all of your installed gadgets.  Locate FolderSlice (look for the pie chart graphic)
  # If you are looking for a specific version to uninstall, or if you want to see more information before you proceed, click the "Show details" button at the bottom-left once you have FolderSlice selected.
  # Right-click on the FolderSlice icon and choose "Uninstall"
  # Answer "Yes" to the prompt "Do you want to uninstall FolderSlice?"

That's all there is to it.  FolderSlice and all its files have now been removed from your system.
