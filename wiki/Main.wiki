= System Requirements =
The only requirement is that you have Microsoft Windows Vista.  The plug-in is insignificantly small (less than one megabyte, or about one-third the size of your average MP3), and generally uses very little memory (if you would like more information, you are encouraged to read the [TechnicalDetails Technical Details] page).
